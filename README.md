### dim5 - Go 3D Game Engine

**dim5** is an OpenGL 3D Game Engine written and for the Go language. The name stands for the fifth dimension, which is after length, height, depth and time, fun ðŸ˜‰.


dim5 is a fork of the [G3N game engine](https://github.com/g3n/engine). I have forked G3N, because I want to change some of the fundamental concepts. First dim5 should be almost panic free, because I think that in error cases a useful error should be returned, and it should be the up to the programmer to take the right path. So (s)he could gather useful informations for debuging.

While dim5 has already moved a bit from G3N, it is not a dropin replacement.

The API will change in the future.
